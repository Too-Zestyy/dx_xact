# dx_xact

`dx_xact` intends to provide a simple interface for manipulating 
[DirectX's XACT audio file formats](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/XACT) 
(NOTE: This project intends to target DX9 formats in the case that changes were made for DX 10 and 11).

An MVP would allow for parsing and generation of XACT files programmatically, 
as opposed to being forced to use [old SDKs](https://archive.org/details/dx9sdk) to produce them.
